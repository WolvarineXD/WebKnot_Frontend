# **App Name**: ResumeRank

## Core Features:

- Login Page: Login page with email input and 'Login' button. Navigates to the dashboard upon submission. No actual authentication is implemented; any email proceeds to the dashboard.
- Dashboard Input: Dashboard section for uploading up to 500 resumes. Placeholder UI; no real file processing. Supports adding and removing dynamic parameters (skill name and weight).
- Scoring Output Table: Displays candidate data, including name, phone, email, skill scores, and overall score. Allows sorting and filtering by overall score and individual skill scores. Data updates in real-time on the frontend.
- Export to CSV: Exports the displayed table data to a CSV file.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Muted Blue (#79A3B1) for a calm and professional feel.
- Background color: Very Light Blue (#F0F4F5), close to white to highlight the data.
- Accent color: Teal (#68B0AB), for interactive elements and highlights, drawing users' eyes without overwhelming them.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, neutral, and readable UI.
- Use simple, outline-style icons for clarity and a professional look. Icons should complement the text labels.
- Use a clean, grid-based layout with consistent spacing and padding. The dashboard should be intuitive, with clear sections for input, data display, and export options.
- Subtle transitions and animations for loading states and UI updates. These should be fast and unobtrusive.
